# hello-world
I dont konw what this is,but I really wanna study and work in CS area,so lets start it !

lets try make some changes! The guide said I should introduce myself,so that is what I am gonna do.
I'm a student of CSU(center south university in China), but I am not in CS. I have read the book C++ primer and do the homework,and I'm studying the cappa by watching the open courses of CMU.I hope I can be a programmer next year,and nothing is too late.
